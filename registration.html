        <h2>Participant registration</h2>

        
        <p><strong>Registration is now closed, including registration for virtual attendance. </strong></p>
        <h2 class="mt-5">Going hybrid</h2>
        <p>This year we are planning to bring you the BioHackathon face-to-face, with remote access available i.e. hybrid attendance. </p>

<p>We believe the new format will allow everyone to participate in the BioHackathon and deliver tangible outcomes from the selected projects.</p>

<p>BioHackathon Europe has limited space for face-to-face participation. The registration is based on a first-come, first-served basis. </p>
<h2 class="mt-5">Attendance at the venue</h2>
        <p>All participants are required to stay for the whole duration of the meeting, and due to COVID-19 measures all participants are required to stay in the venue.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-5">Code of Conduct</h2>
        <p>The Biohackathon will adhere to the <a href="https://elixir-europe.org/events/code-of-conduct">ELIXIR code of Conduct</a>.</p>

        <h2 class="mt-5">Data protection</h2>
        <p>The registration form gives you the opportunity to share your contact details with other attendees. If you agree to share your details (name, email, affiliation), these will be kept by the ELIXIR Hub and on EvenBrite
        for two months after the event. After this time they will be deleted from both locations. If you want the details to be removed earlier, or if you have any queries, please contact us at <a href="mailto:biohackathon-europe@elixir-europe.org">biohackathon-europe@elixir-europe.org</a>.</p>
