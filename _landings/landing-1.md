background: |
    Following the success of the previous editions of the BioHackathon Europe ([2018](https://2018.biohackathon-europe.org/), [2019](https://2019.biohackathon-europe.org/), [2020](https://2020.biohackathon-europe.org/) and [2021](https://2021.biohackathon-europe.org/)) organised by [ELIXIR Europe](https://elixir-europe.org), and building on the BioHackathons organised by National Bioscience Database Center ([NBDC](https://biosciencedbc.jp/?lng=en)) and Database Center for Life Science ([DBCLS](https://dbcls.rois.ac.jp/index-en.html)), we are planning to run BioHackathon Europe 2022 in Paris 7-11 November 2022. We hope to build on our success and encourage more ELIXIR and non-ELIXIR participants to take part, as well as attract further industry engagement.

scope: |
    BioHackathon activities are driven by practical sessions where people gather, discuss, and implement ideas and projects during intensive and productive coding sessions. The topics will be aligned to challenges proposed by [ELIXIR Platforms](https://elixir-europe.org/platforms), [ELIXIR Communities](https://elixir-europe.org/communities), and/or [Focus Groups](https://elixir-europe.org/focus-groups), and a set of common challenges proposed by the sister [BioHackathon](http://www.biohackathon.org) organised in Japan.
